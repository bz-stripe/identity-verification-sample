## How to run locally

This sample includes 5 server implementations in Node, Ruby, Python, Java, and PHP for the two integration types: [using-webhooks](/using-webhooks) and [without-webhooks](/without-webhooks). 

Follow the steps below to run locally.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/bz-stripe/identity-verification-sample
```

**2. Copy the .env.example to a .env file:**

Copy the .env.example file into a file named .env in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.example using-webhooks/server/node/.env
```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Stripe [developer dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) to find your API keys and update your .env file with the keys.

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

`CLIENT_DIR` tells the server where to the client files are located and does not need to be modified unless you move the server files.

**3. Follow the server instructions on how to run:**

Pick the server language you want and follow the instructions in the server folder README on how to run.

For example, if you want to run the Node server in `using-webhooks`:

```
cd using-webhooks/server/node # there's a README in this folder with instructions
npm install
npm start
```

**4. [Optional] Run a webhook locally:**

If you want to test the `using-webhooks` integration with a local webhook on your machine, you can use the Stripe CLI to easily spin one up.

First [install the CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and [link your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#link-account).

```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

The CLI will print a webhook secret key to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your .env file.

You should see events logged in the console where the CLI is running.

When you are ready to create a live webhook endpoint, follow our guide in the docs on [configuring a webhook endpoint in the dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/setup#configure-webhook-settings). 


## FAQ
Q: Why did you pick these frameworks?

A: We chose the most minimal framework to convey the key Stripe calls and concepts you need to understand. These demos are meant as an educational tool that helps you roadmap how to integrate Stripe within your own system independent of the framework.

Q: Can you show me how to build X?

A: We are always looking for new sample ideas, please email dev-samples@stripe.com with your suggestion!
